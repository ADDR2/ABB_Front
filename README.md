# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements to run

In order to run this project you will need Node installed in your machine (version >= 12.16.2). Then you will need to run the following command:

```
$> npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Missing features (next steps)

* Add environment variables
* Add linter (ESLint)
* Add dashboard page to see the full list of Parts/pieces produced
* Improve toasts look & feel
* Create a `contants.js` file with all constants
* Add lazy load for other pages
* Add special buttons (arrow up and arrow down) in small screens (phones and tablets) to avoid having several scrolls
* Add three dots button to generate only some rows and not all of them. Given that a virtual scroll is in use, the three dots button will only reduce the amount of memory usage
* Create custom hooks to avoid repeating them in several places
